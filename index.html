        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Volleyball Coachüèê</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a volleyball coach, my job is more than just teaching the sport; it's about shaping young athletes, fostering teamwork, and igniting a passion for the game. 
        As a coach, there are certain skills I must have to help me and my team be successful. 
        I must be able to properly communicate with players and parents, be organized enough to keep track of players and practice plans, stay calm in stressful situations such as arguments, fights, or players getting hurt, and be positive all the time, especially when the team is having a rough practice. 
        Before coaching, the experience I had was playing volleyball for 6 years. As for coaching, I was an assistant coach for two years at the club level, coached the freshmen team at a high school for a year, head coached the 14s team at a club for a year, and am currently still doing that, as well as coaching the junior varsity team at a high school. 
        The job is one that is very rewarding and worth the while. I enjoy being able to play a role in shaping these young individuals as well as helping them grow their passion for the sport.<br><br>

        Outside of practice, I have to plan ahead and come up with practice plans. I strategize drills, formations, and plays, catering to the team's strengths and weaknesses.
        Game-film analysis helps identify areas for improvement. I also build relationships. Getting¬†to know each player's individual goals, personalities, and learning styles is crucial in order for me to be able to coach effectively and build trust with my players. 
        Teaching my players the ethics behind teamwork and instilling the importance of communication, collaboration, and sportsmanship sets the foundation for a positive team dynamic, and that is what I strive to do.<br><br>

        When it comes to running the actual practice, I must include all of the following: Warm-up and conditioning, such as dynamic stretches, agility drills, and light cardio, prepare bodies and minds for the physical demands of the game. 
        As a coach,¬†I must guide players through drills that hone basic techniques like passing, serving, spiking, and setting, gradually increasing complexity. 
        To build¬†volleyball IQ with my players, I must explain game rules, strategies, and court positioning, helping players understand the tactical nuances of the sport.¬†
        Scrimmages and games after practicing put skills to the test in a competitive setting, allowing me as a coach to assess progress, identify areas for growth, and keep the game exciting.
        As for beyond the court and helping players be better people, I try to encourage¬†and motivate as a coach. I celebrate successes, offer constructive criticism, and help players bounce back from setbacks, fostering resilience and a growth mindset. 
        Teach life lessons. Sportsmanship, communication, teamwork, and goal-setting are valuable skills that transcend the volleyball court, and as a coach, try to play a vital role in shaping well-rounded individuals. 
        Lastly, to build¬†community, I connect with parents, create a supportive environment, and organize team-building activities to strengthen the team spirit.
